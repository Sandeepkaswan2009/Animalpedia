        <h2 class="heading">Life in The Jungle</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Animal life in the jungle is rich, diverse, and forms a complex
          ecosystem where various species coexist and depend on one another for
          survival. Jungles, often referring to dense tropical rainforests and
          thick forests, are home to a vast array of animals, including mammals,
          birds, reptiles, amphibians, and countless insects. Predators like
          tigers, leopards, and jaguars roam the forest floor, hunting
          herbivores such as deer, wild boars, and monkeys. The trees are alive
          with activity, hosting creatures like sloths, birds, snakes, and
          tree-dwelling insects. Jungles also provide ideal habitats for
          colorful birds like parrots and hornbills, as well as various species
          of frogs, many of which are known for their vibrant colors and
          distinctive calls.
          <br />
          <br />
          The jungle ecosystem is intricately balanced, with each species
          playing a vital role. Herbivores help control vegetation growth,
          predators keep prey populations in check, and decomposers like fungi
          and insects recycle nutrients back into the soil. The dense foliage
          and layered structure of jungles—ranging from the canopy to the forest
          floor—create numerous microhabitats, allowing different species to
          thrive. These forests also support a remarkable diversity of plant
          life, providing food and shelter for animals. Despite their abundance,
          jungles face threats from deforestation, poaching, and climate change,
          making conservation efforts crucial to preserving the incredible
          biodiversity they harbor.

          <h2 class="breeds">Deers</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Deer in India are diverse and play a vital role in the country's rich
          biodiversity. Several species inhabit Indian forests, grasslands, and
          wetlands, with some of the most common being the chital (spotted
          deer), sambar deer, barasingha (swamp deer), and the Indian muntjac
          (barking deer). The chital, with its reddish-brown coat dotted with
          white spots, is the most widely seen, often found in herds grazing in
          forest clearings. The sambar deer, India’s largest deer species, has a
          dark brown coat and large, rugged antlers, and is known for being a
          primary prey of the Bengal tiger. Barasingha, distinguished by its
          impressive antlers with multiple tines, thrives in swampy grasslands,
          while the smaller muntjac is noted for its barking-like calls used to
          alert others of danger.
          <br />
          <br />
          Deer hold ecological and cultural significance in India. They are a
          crucial part of the food chain, serving as prey for top predators like
          tigers and leopards, which helps maintain ecosystem balance.
          Culturally, deer are featured in Indian mythology and are often
          associated with gentleness and grace. Conservation efforts, including
          protected areas and national parks like Ranthambore, Kanha, and
          Kaziranga, have been established to safeguard deer populations.
          Despite these measures, habitat loss and poaching remain threats,
          emphasizing the importance of continued protection to ensure the
          survival of these graceful creatures.

          <h2 class="breeds">Peacock</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          The Indian Peacock (Pavo cristatus), also known as the common peafowl,
          is the national bird of India and is renowned for its vibrant plumage
          and spectacular courtship displays. The male peacock is famous for its
          iridescent blue-green feathers and a long, colorful train adorned with
          eye-shaped patterns that it fans out to attract females. In contrast,
          the female, called a peahen, has more subdued brownish feathers,
          helping her blend into the surroundings while nesting. Indian peacocks
          are native to the Indian subcontinent and are commonly found in
          forests, grasslands, and near human settlements, where they feed on
          seeds, insects, small reptiles, and fruits.
          <br />
          <br />
          Indian peacocks play a significant role in Indian culture and
          mythology, symbolizing beauty, grace, and pride. They are known for
          their loud calls, especially during the monsoon season when they are
          most active in mating rituals. Despite their dazzling appearance,
          peacocks are capable of short bursts of flight, usually to escape
          predators or roost in trees at night. Although they are protected
          under Indian law, habitat loss and hunting for their feathers pose
          threats in some areas. However, their adaptability and cultural
          reverence help ensure their survival in many regions of India.

          <h2 class="breeds">Crocodiles</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Crocodiles are large, carnivorous reptiles that belong to the family
          Crocodylidae. They are found in tropical regions of Africa, Asia, the
          Americas, and Australia, typically inhabiting freshwater habitats like
          rivers, lakes, wetlands, and sometimes brackish waters. Known for
          their powerful jaws, sharp teeth, and strong tails, crocodiles are
          apex predators, feeding on fish, birds, mammals, and occasionally
          larger prey. They have a tough, scaly skin that provides protection
          and helps regulate their body temperature. Despite their bulky
          appearance, crocodiles are excellent swimmers and can move
          surprisingly fast on land over short distances.
          <br />
          <br />
          Crocodiles are ancient creatures that have existed for over 200
          million years, surviving major evolutionary changes. They play a
          crucial role in their ecosystems by maintaining healthy fish
          populations and preventing the spread of disease through scavenging.
          Crocodiles communicate using vocalizations, body movements, and even
          chemical signals. Females are protective mothers, building nests and
          guarding their eggs until they hatch. Although crocodiles are
          dangerous to humans if provoked, many species face threats from
          habitat destruction, pollution, and illegal hunting, leading to
          conservation efforts to protect them.
